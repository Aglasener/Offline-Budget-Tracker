## Description

* Users can view all their expenses on a bar graph
* Users can reset their saved expenses

## Setup/Installation Requirements

Merely click the link and be redirected to the online web app: https://glacial-everglades-04689.herokuapp.com/

## Known Bugs

Can't seem to have it save to the server database, I attempted a fix by adding background-sync functionality to the service-worker. But was unable to make it work with the way webpack bundles the js files. As of now it only saves data to the indexDB.
